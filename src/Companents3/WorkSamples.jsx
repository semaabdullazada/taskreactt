      <h4>What is a work sample?</h4>
A work sample is an opportunity to showcase your skills, abilities and talents to a prospective employer. When interviewers ask for a sample of your work, they're asking to see an example of a finished product, a piece of work or a set of results. Examples might include your portfolio, a presentation you gave or evidence of your sales figures.
Interviewers may ask you to present professional samples of your work from a previous role. Alternatively, they might set you a task to complete as part of the interviewing process. They may then assess your finished product against their set criteria to see if you could be a good candidate for the role.
