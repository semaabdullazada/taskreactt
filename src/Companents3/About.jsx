      <h4>Why checkboxes, why not dropdowns or something else?</h4>
      <p>Something has always drawn me to the browsers native checkbox element, the blue checkbox for some reason appeals to me and really the simplicity of the action and quick response. I can’t really explain it much more than that, I like the element and want to make things with it. I had previously explored this idea with checkbox olympics which unfortunately remains largely incomplete, but wanted to make a stand alone experience.Would you consider a game useful?When it comes down to it, I’m not quite sure… in a way checkbox race is entertainment but because it’s 
      so monotonous and hard to really race through quickly I feel like we’re more into the territory of art vs a game. If anything checkbox race is annoying and challenging rather than enjoyable, though I guess some people also enjoy those things. </p></div>
