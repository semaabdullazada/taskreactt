      <p>
Truly I had been procrastinating on this for a while, and predominantly because pulling all of the images together that would look good and be in the retro style just seemed like one of those boring tasks I never do very well at, but fortunately I stumbled upon a fully open source minesweeper, which had a full set of assets that I could use as well as some clear layoutsâ€¦ once I had that it was more a matter of stripping out the unwanted functionality.
